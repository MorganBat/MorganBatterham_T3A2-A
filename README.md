## Website Description

### Purpose

This website is used to track workouts. There are currently no good websites for tracking workouts. This website will track progression and improvements. There is also the option for the website to automatically plan the rep and weight ranges for future workouts.

For accountability, users will have the option to share their progress and results with their friends, and even create groups and challenges. Users can also give access to their trainers, who can track their client's progress and schedule and plan workouts.

### Functionality/Features



### Target Audience

The target audience for this website is anyone who has an interest in Health and Fitness. Specifically people interested in weightlifting, as the website is built to track reps and weights.

There will also be the option for trainers to access a client's data, to track their progress and assist in the planning of workouts. 

### Tech Stack

This website will be primarily built on the MERN stack:

- *MongoDB* will be used as the database; for the long term, persistent storage of Data.

- *ExpressJS* will be used as the web server, to receive and process HTTP requests.

- *ReactJS* will be used to build the 'front end' of the website. This is the portion that is loaded into the browser, in order to handle user interaction.

- *NodeJS* is a JavaScript runtime which will be used to run the ExpressJS code.
